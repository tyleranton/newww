{{#unless errors}}

  <p>npm On-Site is an on-premises solution for securely sharing and distributing
  JavaScript modules within your organization, from the team that maintains npm
  and the public npm registry. It's designed for teams that need:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>easy internal sharing of private modules</li>
    <li>better control of development and deployment workflow</li>
    <li>stricter security around deploying open-source modules</li>
    <li>compliance with legal requirements to host code on-premises</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="private">npm On-Site is a private npm registry</a></h3>

  <p>npm On-Site is an npm registry that works with the same standard npm client you
  already use, but provides the features needed by larger organizations who
  are now enthusiastically adopting node. It's built by npm, Inc., the sponsor
  of the npm open source project and the host of the public npm registry.</p>

  <h3><a name="scoped">Private, scoped modules</a></h3>

  <p>Lots of companies using Node.js love the "many small modules" pattern that is
  part of the Node culture. However, splitting internal applications and private
  code up into small modules has been inconvenient, requiring git dependencies or
  other workarounds to avoid publishing sensitive code to the public registry. npm
  On-Site makes private modules a first-class citizen. Just log in to your
  registry:

  <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm login --registry=http://myreg.mycompany.com --scope=myco</code></pre>

  <p>Now you can install private modules without any additional work, the same way
  you do with public modules:</p>

  <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm install @myco/somepackage</code></pre>

  <p>npm automatically knows that any package with the <code>@myco</code> scope
  should be installed from your npm On-Site installation. Scoped packages will
  be installed into your <code>node_modules</code> folder and can be used in your
  JavaScript just like any other module:</p>

  <pre><code>require('@myco/somepackage');</code></pre>

  <p>Publishing private modules is similarly easy. Simply give your package name
  a scope in package.json:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-json">{
  "name": "@myco/anypackage"
}</code></pre>

  <p>Then publish as usual:</p>

  <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm publish</code></pre>

  <p>npm will automatically publish to your npm On-Site, and will refuse to
  publish scoped packages to the public registry.</p>

  <h3><a name="conflicts">Eliminate conflicts with public modules</a></h3>

  <p>By their nature, the existence of scopes means you cannot create a module
  that accidentally conflicts with an existing public package.</p>

  <p>In addition, when you register a scope with npm On-Site, we reserve that
    scope across all npm On-Site users and the public registry. This will
    allow you to publish your modules publicly without needing to rename them
    when this feature becomes available in the public registry.</p>

  <h3><a name="compatible">Works in concert with the public npm registry</a></h3>

  <p>Depending on your security preferences, you can work with npm On-Site in
  two ways:
  <ol>
    <li>use it to host only your private modules, and use the public npm registry
      for any un-scoped modules, or</li>
    <li>configure npm to use your local npm On-Site server for all modules, and
      use npm On-Site to mirror the public packages you have approved for
      internal use</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This can be configured per-client, so your developers and your build server
  can apply different levels of strictness about where they can install packages
  from.</p>

  <h3><a name="mirror">Selectively mirror the public registry</a></h3>

  <p>npm On-Site goes beyond a simple local cache of the registry. It allows you to
    selectively mirror the public registry, automatically inspecting every new and
    updated package available in the public registry and applying a security
    policy to determine if it should be made available locally. You can use
    pre-built filters, or you can write your own, which is as simple as writing
    an npm module and publishing it to your local registry. Some possible filters:

  <ul>
    <li>Mirror the entire public registry as a local cache</li>
    <li>Mirror all packages except these blacklisted packages</li>
    <li>Mirror all versions of these whitelisted packages</li>
    <li>Mirror only approved versions of specific packages</li>
    <li>Mirror any package with an acceptable software license</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="install">npm install npmo</a></h3>

  <p>npm On-Site runs locally, on a server you control, with no external
    dependencies (mirroring the public registry of course requires external
    internet access, but mirroring is optional). Many organizations want this for
    security, regulatory, or operational reasons.

  <p>As you would expect, npm On-Site is installed using npm! Our installation
    process asks you a series of simple questions about your local environment,
    and sets up all the services it needs to run.</p>

  <p>npm On-Site has been extensively tested on CentOS 6.5 and Ubuntu 14, and is
    supported on most recent public Linux distributions. It can run inside a
    virtual machine or on standard hardware. Since it can be configured to
    only selectively mirror the public registry in addition to your private
    packages, its disk space requirements are significantly lighter than other
    private registry solutions.</p>

  <h3><a name="github">Integrates with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise</a></h3>

  <p>If your organization uses GitHub or GitHub Enterprise, npm On-Site can be
    configured to automatically use them for login and access control. Simply add a
  repository field to your package.json that points to your repo:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-json">{
  "repository": {
    "url": "git://github.mycompany.com/myco/mypackage.git"
  }
}</code></pre>

  <p>Depending on your configuration, npm On-Site can restrict installation of
    your package to users who have access to the repo for that package, and restrict
  publishing of that package to users who have commit access to the repo.</p>

  <p>npm On-Site uses OAuth to interact with GitHub, and will support any other
    OAuth2 providers. A standalone solution for authentication and authorization is
  coming soon.</p>

  <h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>

  <p>npm On-Site is priced very simply. There are two price points:</p>

  <p>
  <ol>
    <li>Standard pricing is $20/active user/month, with no limit on the number of users.</li>
    <li>A "Starter Pack" for internal pilots and small teams is $25/month, and allows
      up to five active users (no per-user cost).</li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <p>An "active user" is any user who authenticated with the server over the last 30 days,
    for instance to install or publish a package. You can upgrade or downgrade your license
    at any time.</p>
