    <h1>npm On-Site</h1>
    <h2>Signup complete. Time to install!</h2>
  </div>

  <p>Thank you for trying out npm On-Site. To get started, make sure you have a fresh machine that meets the
    <a href="{{requirementsUrl}}">installation requirements</a>, then
    simply run:</p>

  <pre><code class="lang-bash">sudo npm install npmo -g --unsafe</code></pre>

  <p>Once installation is complete visit
    https://your-server-address:8800 and bypass the security warning (you can provide your own certificate later to prevent this warning). You will
    be presented with a management UI which allows you to configure your npm On-Site appliance.
  </p>

  <p>During the configuration process you will be prompted for your email and license key:</p>

  <pre><code>Billing email: {{email}}
License key: {{license_key}}</code></pre>

  <p>The management console allows you to fetch updates, perform backups,
    and configure your npm On-Site appliance.
    For help with configuring npm On-Site, please refer to the
    <a href="{{instructionsUrl}}">documentation</a>. If you
    have any trouble, you can also always contact
    <a href="mailto:{{supportEmail}}">{{supportEmail}}</a>.</p>

  <p>Once you've configured everything, the On-Site registry will be running on
    http://your-server-address:8080.
    Where `your-server-address` is the host name or IP of the machine you have installed npm On-Site on.
  </p>

  <p>A copy of your license key and these instructions has been emailed to
  {{email}}.</p>
